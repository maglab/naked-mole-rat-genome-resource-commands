RunAllPathsLG K=96 THREADS=40 TARGETS=submission EVALUATION=BASIC OVERWRITE=True MIN_CONTIG=500


Ka/Ks ratios estimation with CodeML (from PAML package v3.14) within BioPerl v5.16:

my $kaks_factory = Bio::Tools::Run::Phylo::PAML::Codeml->new(-params => {'runmode' => -2, 'seqtype' => 1, });
$kaks_factory->alignment($dna_aln);
my ($rc, $parser) = $kaks_factory->run();


Functional enrichment using DAVID 6.7:

For functional annotation we entered the top 5% of genes as a gene list and all genes analysed as background. Otherwise default parameters were used.
